# Interns Onboarding Project - FE

This is a boilerplate setup of interns onboarding project for FrontEnd.

### This project includes
1. React
2. Redux
3. Styled-Components
4. Basic Testing Setup

You can choose to add **TypeScript** if you are familiar and feel like working with it.

**Note: You can choose to ignore working with redux and styled-components**

### Prerequisites(if you don't have node)

Check if you already have node with `npm -v` it will display the version of node that you have on your system.

Download and install Node.js from [here](nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have Node.

After installation use
`node -v` to check the node version installed
`npm -v` to check the npm version installed

**Note: If you don't get version then you probably messed up the installation. Please reinstall node.**

By default **npm** will be installed along with node. If not, install the latest version of npm. This will be useful when running all the build commands. Run the following in a command line, either your IDE's Terminal window or in a Windows Command Prompt.
`npm install --global npm@latest`

**Recommended Editor: VS Code**
